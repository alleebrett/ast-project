<!DOCTYPE html><!--The goal for the first session was to make ahtml page utilizing css syle sheets. I have done that on this, the first page of my game. In my style sheets I have chosen copperplate as my preferred font for my h1, but in case that isn't available I have chosen some back up fonts.I understand that if I want to I can assign different size, style and colorattributes to different fonts on my page and that I can groupthose fonts together by assigning different catagory codes of h1, h2, body, p, etc.I understand now why people use images for the text insteadof writing everything in html, because there aren'ta ton of fonts that will show up in every browser. My question for thissession is what are the benefits or drawbacks of making a webpage completely out of links to pdfs you made on your computer vs. code written in html. I think the short answer is, when you use html you get something thatisn't static and can be changed over and over again, because when you make a page in html you can change the attributes without having to put togther a new pdf or document everytime you want to change something on the page. I have included images and links.--><!--For my portfolio I have chosen to make a short choose your own adventure game involving zombies as they are the subject of my thesis and an interest of mine. Everytime throughout the game you see the word zombie, click on the wordfor a link to a resource that I am using for my thesis writing.--><html>  <head>    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">    <script src="script.js"></script>  </head>  <body><center>    <center><img src="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/3/005/05c/08e/36a9765.jpg" width=300 height=200 /></center>    <h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie" STYLE="text-decoration: none"target="_blank"> <span style ="color:white;">Zombie</span></a>      Choose Your Own Adventure Game Starts Here !</h2>    <p><a href="http://plnkr.co/edit/5B3yG2?p=preview" STYLE="text-decoration: none"target="_blank"><span style ="color:white;">Click Here to Begin Your Adventure</span></p>  </center></body></html>
